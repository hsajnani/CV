Dear Faculty Search Committee:

I am applying for the position of tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara with a focus in software engineering as advertised here: 
\url{https://recruit.ap.ucsb.edu/apply/JPF01312}

I am a software engineering researcher with a computer science background in
machine learning, information retrieval and statistics. My research strives to make the current
generation of programmers more productive --- by building assistive tools \& techniques, and conducting 
empirical studies that provide more insight about software development and evolution. I conduct research heavily based on empirical data for assessing value of design ideas and for extracting knowledge out of very large datasets, often by challenging existing beliefs. 

The impact of my research include over a couple of dozen publications, technology transfers to Microsoft, and contributions to Azure DevOps (\url{https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-devops/}) --- a Microsoft's product that span the breadth of the development lifecycle to help developers ship software faster and with higher quality. Azure DevOps is used by over 5 million developers all over the world as their engineering infrastructure. This uniquely large user base enables me to conduct studies and evaluate hypothesis at a scale that is not feasible in traditional lab settings.

I finished my Ph.D. in Information and Computer Sciences with a focus on software engineering from University of California, Irvine in 2016. 
Since then, I am working as a research engineer in Tools for Software Engineers (TSE) 
group at Microsoft. During my tenure at TSE,  I have developed the ability to identify areas where software engineering research can contribute
to drive real impact in practice. My performance over the past couple of year has
shown that I can create and implement research agendas, obtain funding, and mentor students to publish papers.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
